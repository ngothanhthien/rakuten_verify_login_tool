# Rakuten Project

## Development Workflow

This project uses TypeScript and runs directly via `tsx` (no compilation needed for development).

### Scripts

- `npm start` - Run the application (uses tsx to run TypeScript directly)
- `npm run dev` - Same as start (for development)
- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript (outputs to `dist/` - optional)

### Project Structure

```
rakuten/
├── application/       # Application layer (use cases, services)
├── core/             # Domain layer (entities, value objects)
├── infrastructure/   # Infrastructure layer (DB, HTTP, external services)
├── frontend/         # Frontend Vue application
├── dist/             # Compiled JavaScript (optional, generated by build)
└── node_modules/     # Dependencies
```

### Development

1. Make changes to `.ts` files
2. Run `npm start` to run the application
3. The application will run TypeScript directly using `tsx`

### Notes

- **No compilation needed**: `tsx` runs TypeScript files directly
- All `.js` files in source directories are ignored by git (they shouldn't exist)
- The `dist/` folder is only used if you manually run `npm run build`
- Never manually create `.js` files in source directories
